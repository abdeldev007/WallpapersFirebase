this app will take you through the Pixabay Api and how to work with Apis using Retrofit ,  
it has a simple fine design(i believe ) and also i integrated Admobe and Facebook audience to it .
PS : the app i made by me from scratch so feel free to use it ,
but just add your touch to it and in case you are not into professional Reskin i can do that for you just for several dollars
